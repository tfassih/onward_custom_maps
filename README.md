# onward_custom_maps
- Repo for custom maps built in Unity for the VR game Onward

# Initial Setup
- Follow the instructions found here to install and configure Unity and VS: https://www.onwardthegame.com/doc/CustomContentGuide.pdf

# Target Platform
- Meta Quest 2 using either AirLink or a link cable to PC is the targeted minimum
- HTC Vive, Valve Index, Oculus Rift, and other mainstream (non-standalone) headsets are expected to exceed the minimum standards set forth in testing

# Standard Operational Procedures
- For each individual map, a distinct project and production branch will be created
- To modify a production branch, a developer must clone prod to a personal branch, make whatever changes, then put in a PR to merge that branch with prod
- All maps should be optimized to run at an average minimum of 60fps
- Platform specific SDK packages/files are not to be included in commits
- No cutscenes, non-player-controlled camera movement, or third-person POV 
- All textures must be PBR format and be properly mapped to their respective objects
- No advertising of any sort
- Racist/Nazi/insertShitbagGroupHere will result in a drone strike being accidentally called on your position, on purpose. I will <s>take your scalp</s> dox you
